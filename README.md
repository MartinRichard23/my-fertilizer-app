# Fertilizer Calibration App Designed By Martin Richardson
## Thoughts behind the app:
I first starting thinking about designing this app because I work currently on a golf course. On golf courses we use a lot of different fertilizers and a lot of different types of spreaders. 
So I thought maybe there is a way to bring all of those different calibration tables and mathimatical equations into one place. So I figured with my background in software and background in 
agronomy why not create an app that could help this. 
## Features: 
- Add and edit custom spreaders
- Calculate based on NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) levels
- Support default and custom fertilizer rates
- Calibration tables for multiple different spreaders
- Even Triwave Seeder support

## Updates:
4/16/2025:
The first push to github today. Thought I might as well put this out there so if I apply for a job they can at least see what I have done with it so far. 
Yesterday I put in the Triwave page and added the ability to edit and delete from archived applications. Tomorrow most likely going to work on security of the app
and adding in more settings and theme changes to the app. Still waiting to get a list of common fertilizers used at my current job and waiting to get access to calibration information
for the Centerliner. I will be updating this more frequent. Hopefully this project turns out well.
